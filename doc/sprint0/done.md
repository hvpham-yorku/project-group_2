What done means For the Features we will implement?

• Requirements for Function Met: Every function that has been defined for patrons (such book searches, reservations, and loan extensions) and library employees (including inventory monitoring and fine administration) has been completely implemented and is operating as planned. 

• User Interface Consistency: Both patrons and library employees may enjoy a smooth, intuitive experience thanks to the UI's alignment with design standards.

• Thorough Testing: All modules undergo unit testing, acceptance testing is done on important user paths, and usability testing verifies that non-technical users can easily utilize the system. 

• Documentation: User manuals are available for both staff and customer functions, and technical documentation is comprehensive. 

• Stakeholder Approval: To guarantee conformity with project objectives, all features are examined and authorized by project stakeholders, such as team members and course instructors.
