Team Organization & Tools: We effectively collaborated by delegating duties to meet project deadlines using modern tools such as Discord. Trello was introduced by our professor, and we utilized it to coordinate project features through User Stories, thereby increasing our productivity. Furthermore, we implemented GitHub as a version control system to facilitate collaboration and monitor changes, thereby facilitating cloud-based access to our code.

Decision-Making: In order to guarantee fair decision-making, we conducted substantial discussions and voting on Discord calls, considering a variety of perspectives regarding the project's trajectory. This method enabled all team members to contribute and establish consensus on critical components.

User Story Prioritization: Following the analysis of User Stories, we conducted three rounds of voting to establish a consensus on priority levels. This guaranteed that all team members were able to contribute their opinions on the most critical features.

Meeting Frequency: We convened three times per week to ensure that we remained on schedule and met our deadlines, as Sprint 0 was heavily reliant on documentation.

Insights for Future Phases: In order to expedite the initial design process, we intend to establish duties and responsibilities at the outset. Additionally, establishing a shared vision at an earlier stage will enable us to allocate additional time to development, thereby enabling the inclusion of supplementary features.
