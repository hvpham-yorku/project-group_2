Handy Library Manager

Handy Library Manager is an affordable, easy-to-use system for small to 
medium libraries, offering:
•	Cataloging, borrower management, and circulation tracking
•	A simple interface, ideal for non-technical users and volunteers

How Library Hub is Different:
•	Advanced features for larger, interactive libraries, such as 
reservations, shopping cart, user reviews, fine management, and inventory 
updates
Designed for libraries with more complex needs

Target Users and Scenarios for Library Hub:
Users: Larger libraries with frequent patron interactions or 
multi-location access
Scenarios: Libraries needing features like multi-book selection, user 
accounts, loan extensions, and reviews for better engagement

Why Competitors Don’t Target These Scenarios:
York University Library: Focuses on simple borrowing needs for university 
students, lacking multi-library and review features.
Handy Library Manager: Geared toward small libraries prioritizing 
simplicity and affordability, so advanced features would add complexity 
and cost.
